  dialouge_1: 'They drowned in soda

'
  dialouge_2: The can was the murder weapon
  dialouge_3: The soda's manufacturer sent a hitman after the victim
  case_option_1: Dude if you can drown in this soda you must be the size of a small
    lemon, i guess its not impossible though...
  case_option_2: What, did they slap the can across the guys head until he bled to
    death? Thats not too farfetched of an idea...
  case_option_3: Your saying the soda manufacturer sent a hit after the victim? I
    wonder what he did to anger someone that important.
