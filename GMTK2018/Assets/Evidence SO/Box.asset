  dialouge_1: He jumped inside this box to invoke his imagination!
  dialouge_2: Must have been waiting for this package for a while
  dialouge_3: This must be one of those boxing day limited edition cardboard boxes!
  case_option_1: People still jump into boxes for imagination? What a loser.
  case_option_2: Seems like he had Amazon prime, but maybe the package came late this
    time.
  case_option_3: I heard Dbrand had some cardboard boxes to sell and they sold 20,000
    of their limited edition boxes in one day. Your saying it could be that very same
    box?
