  dialouge_1: Clearly they were playing dominos because they were waiting for a pizza
  dialouge_2: 11 domino is signifying 11-11-11, thats the day Skrim came out!
  dialouge_3: They must have gambled with this!
  case_option_1: A piping hot dominos pizza was involved? Understandable i guess...
  case_option_2: So you are saying he must have been playing Skyrim or something when
    the incident occured? Interesting...
  case_option_3: They gambled their life savings away? Seems like there would be better
    games to play then dominos...like cards or something, but i guess that makes sense...
